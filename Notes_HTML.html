		THE INTERNET

	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>HTML</em> is the basis of web documents and glues together other things like
		images and video. Internet <em>Browsers</em> make requests using a protocol called 
		<em>HTTP</em>, and these requests are received by the <em>Server</em> where the files 
		are stored. The <em>Server</em> sends these files back to your computer where your 
		<em>Browser</em> interprets them into the web page you see.

	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>HTML</em> makes up the greater portion of what's on the internet. It includes <em>Text
		Content</em>, as well as <em>Mark Up</em> that formats some of what you see, and <em>References</em> 
		to other documents. <em>Mark Up</em> in <em>HTML</em> is made up of <em>Tags. Tags</em> are like
		instructions to tell a browser what <em>Elements</em> to use. <em>Elements</em> that 
		<em>Tags</em> produce can be <em>Inline</em> or <em>Block. Block Elements</em> create an invisible 
		box around the content while <em>Inline Elements</em> only work along single lines.

	HTML Structure 
</h2>

<div class="concept">
	
	<h3>
		HTML STRUCTURE
	</h3>
		
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		The standard structure of an <em>HTML</em> document is much like a tree. The tree branches 
		off in multiple directions from a central sort of trunk. This structure is sometimes called a 
		<em>DOM</em> or a <em>Document Object Model</em>. <em>HTML</em>s structure is basically boxes 
		inside of boxes inside of boxes, each box being an <em>Element</em> (<em>Tag</em>). Coders
		usually use indentation within the structure of the code they are writing. This isn't understood
		by the computer, but allows the code to have more visual organization for the coder.

	Adding CSS Style
</h2>

<div class="concept">

	<h3>
		CASCADING STYLE SHEETS (CSS)
	</h3>
		
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>CSS</em> controls the style of different <em>HTML Elements</em>. For example, this text is 
		within a paragraph tag, and <em>CSS</em> is applying the font type and the text alignment for 
		paragraph tag.

		REPETITION
	</h3>
	
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Most objectives can be reached with slightly different code. One might apply 
		apply a single <em>CSS</em> font to 10 of their <em>elements</em> and others to 2 
		<em>elements</em>, when it would have been more efficient to apply that font to a broader 
		element (like the body) and then just apply the 2 other fonts to their proper elements. The 
		first way involves needless <em>repetition</em> which wastes time and increases the likelihood 
		of errors. The problem compounds further when things need to be changed or errors are made, 
		as fixing them will also be more time consuming. Simplifying a lot of style into reusable tags
		is an example of <a href='#abstraction_2'><u>Abstraction</u></a> - or reducing something to it's essential characteristics.

<div class="concept">

	<h3>
		Computer Programs
	</h3>
	
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>Computers</em> do nothing alone, but can do anything that we can <em>program</em> them 
		to do. They need precise instructions to do things, and that is what a <em>program</em> is. 		
	</p>

<div class="concept">

	<h3>
		Programming Languages
	</h3>
	
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Various <em>programming languages</em> are used to give computers instructions. 
		<em>Python</em> is the example being used in this lesson. These languages have grammars, in 
		that there is a set of governing rules as to how they must be written in order to be 
		interpreted by the computer.

	<h3>
		Python Expressions
	</h3>
	
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		A <em>Python expression</em> is a Python statement which can be understood by Python.
		For example "print 1+1" is a functioning <em>Python expression</em>, and a <em>Python 
		interpreter</em> would easily print out 2. "print 1+" is not a <em>Python expression</em> 
		because it is not complete and the Python interpreter would would come back with a syntax 
		error.

	Variables and Strings
</h2>

<div class="concept">

	<h3>
		Python Variables
	</h3>
	
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>Variables</em> are a way to name certain <em>values</em> in Python. This is helpful 
		because it improves code readability, but also functionally, as it allows values to 
		change. For example:
	</p>
	
			<div class="object">
			
					<b>number = 1
						<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					print number * 20</b>
						<br><br>
					This prints 20, because the variable "number" has taken the value of 1.
			
			</div>

<div class="concept">

	<h3>
		Equals Symbol (=)
	</h3>
	
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>Equals symbols</em> have a different meaning in Python than in math. In Python they mean
		that something will take the value of the other, even if that makes no mathematical sense.
		For example:
	</p>
	
			<div class="object">
			
				<b>number = 10
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				number = number - 5
					<br>
				print number</b>
					<br><br>
				This prints 5, even though "number" is first defined as 10. The second time "number" is given 
				a value it takes 5 away from the original value of "number", and reassigns that value to
				the variable "number", thus when we print it we get 10-5, or 5. This is also an example of
				how the value of a variable can change, as mentioned in the previous concept.

	<h3>
		Strings
	</h3>
	
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		In Python, <em>strings</em> are enclosed within single or double quotations. Either work, but the 
		closing and ending type must match. Things within a string will not be recognized as numbers.
	</p>

</div>

<h2 id="lesson_6">
	Input -> Function -> Output
</h2>

<div class="concept">

	<h3>
		Functions
	</h3>
	
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>Functions</em> take some <em>input</em> and do something to it, producing an <em>output</em>. 
		A <em>function</em> could, for example, add two numbers no matter what those numbers are.
	</p>

</div>

		<a href="#beginning">Back to Top</a>

<div class="concept">

	<h3>
		Parts of a Function
	</h3>
	
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>Functions</em> are started by the keyword <em>def</em> followed by the name of the 
		<em>function</em>. This is then followed by the <em>functions</em> <em>parameters</em> in 
		parenthesis immediately following the <em>functions</em> name, separated by commas and ended 
		with a colon. Next is the body of the <em>function</em>, which is what the function is going 
		to do to the <em>parameters</em>. When printing the result of a <em>function</em> you print the 
		name of the function, followed by the values which are to take the place of the <em>parameters</em>
		in the <em>function</em>
	</p>

</div>

		<a href="#beginning">Back to Top</a>
		
<div class="concept">

	<h3>
		Functions and Repetition
	</h3>
	
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>Functions</em> help to avoid repetition because it only needs to be defined once. A 
		<em>function</em> which adds two numbers can be called upon any time that two numbers need
		adding within the code without redefining it.
	</p>

	<h3>
		Return Statements
	</h3>
	
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>Return statements</em> tell Python exactly what a <em>function</em> should produce
		as <em>output</em>. For example, if the body of a function was that a + b = c then the <em>return 
		statement</em> should either be "return c", or simply put all of it in the 
		<em>return statement</em> like "return a + b".

	If, Else, While, and Debugging
</h2>
		
<div class="concept">

	<h3>
		If
	</h3>
	
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>If statements</em> are statements used in Python to make code do something different depending
		upon the result of a comparison. Indented within an <em>if statement</em> is a block which 
		contains what the code will do if the <em>if statement</em> evaluates to true.
	</p>

</div>

		<a href="#beginning">Back to Top</a>

<div class="concept">

	<h3>
		Else
	</h3>
	
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>Else statements</em> are used in addition to <em>if statements</em> to tell code what to do
		if the <em>if statement</em> evaluates to false. Else statements are along the same indentation 
		as the same <em>if statement</em> and also have an indented block within them.
	</p>

<div class="concept">

	<h3>
		While Loops
	</h3>
	
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em> While loops</em> are another Python statement which do something multiple times. You 
		set a condition under which it will continue, and it will continue until the input no longer
		meets that condition.
	</p>

	<h3>
		Debugging Tips
	</h3>
	
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If code is causing an error, it's best to start by examining the error message. The last line 
		usually gives the best information to help you figure out the problem. It's also helpful to 
		compare your code to working examples of similar code, and to check that whatever code you
		may have based yours upon works also. It's most difficult to figure out an issue when the code
		doesn't produce any error, but doesn't do what you want it to. In many cases it's helpful when
		debugging something like this to print individual parts of your code to see what isn't working 
		exactly.

</h2>

<div class="concept">

	<h3 id='abstraction_2'>
		Object Oriented Programming
	</h3>
	
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>Object Oriented Programming</em> is programming based on the concept of <em>Objects</em>
		and <em>Procedures</em>, often also known as <em>Attributes</em> and <em>Methods</em>. Object 
		Oriented Programming is useful because it allows programmers to understand and create a great 
		deal of complex code without knowing everything about how the objects in their code work - just 
		what they actually do. It encourages the reuse of code, and is an example of 
		<a href="#abstraction_1"><u>Abstraction</u></a> (REVIEWER - Please use the "Abstraction" link to 
		see an explicit connection between OOP and CSS/HTML).

	<h3>
		Modules, Classes, Objects and Instances
	</h3>
	
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>Modules</em> in Python are sort of like containers for code to access with the "." operator.
		The <em>webbrowser, time, os, and turtle</em> modules are examples of Python modules in the 
		<em>Python Standard Library</em> (a set of files containing procedures that are regularly 
		used in Python and come with Python). <em>Classes</em> are much like modules in that they store 
		code to be accessed with the "." operator, however there will only be one module for a whole 
		program, but many potential instances of a class which don't interfere with each other. 
		<em>Instances</em> are subsequent uses of a class. For example as used in the lesson, there might 
		be a class called movie, and 10 instances of this class, all of which are particular movies. 
		These individual instances of a class are Objects.

	<h3>
		Class and Instance Variables
	</h3>
	
	<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>Instance Variables</em> are variables associated with every instance of a class, and have 
		different copies with different values for each instance. <em>Class Variables</em> are variables 
		that have the same values for all instances, such as the example of movie ratings on a movie 
		website.

	<h3>
		Method Overriding
	</h3>
	
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	If a method is defined by the same name in a class and subclass, then the return will depend on 
	whether it's called through the class or subclass. This is called method overriding.
